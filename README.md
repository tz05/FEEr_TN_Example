# Dataset background

This __TN_FEEr.RData__ file was used to demonstrate the usage of the [FEEr package](https://github.com/tz05/FEEr) and the application of FEE index ([Zhang et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7577)) to studying FIA plots in Tennessee. The detailed introduction of this application can be found in our manuscript titled ___FEEr: An R package for calculating Functional Extension and Evenness index___, which uses this RData as the reference dataset for readers to download and practise. Simply saying, the FIA plots included in this dataset are the FIA national design forest plots remeasured in 2017. Raw FIA data was downloaded from [FIA DataMart (FIADB_1.9.0)](https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fia/datamart/) on July 8th 2021.

# Content

__TN_FEEr.RData__  file contains 6 variables.

* __`pool`__: a 91×2 data frame containing species trait information for the species pool in this application. The special pool is composed of the tree species found in the FIA plots (totally 91 species). Each row corresponds to a species in the pool, with row name of the species code ([SPCD](https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/library/database-documentation/current/ver90/FIADB%20User%20Guide%20P2_9-0_final.pdf)) used in FIA. The columns correspond to the functional traits of species. We included two traits in this example: drought tolerance (DT) and shade tolerance (ST). The source of trait data is [Niinemets and Valladares (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9615(2006)076[0521:TTSDAW]2.0.CO;2).
* __`comm`__: a 471×91 data frame containing species abundance information for each FIA plot. Each row corresponds to a FIA plot (totally 471 communities), with row names of the plot sequence number ([PLT_CN](https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/library/database-documentation/current/ver90/FIADB%20User%20Guide%20P2_9-0_final.pdf)) used in FIA. The columns correspond to the 91 species in the species pool. As in `pool`, [SPCD](https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/library/database-documentation/current/ver90/FIADB%20User%20Guide%20P2_9-0_final.pdf) is used as column names to specify the species. The abundance values in this data frame are in the unit of pound/acre.
* __`plt_FORGRP`__ and __`frttyp`__: `plt_FORGRP` is a 266×2 data frame showing the forest type group of FIA plots. `frttyp` is a 34×2 data frame showing the mapping relationship between codes and names of forest type groups contained in these plots. These forest type group codes and names are used in [FIA](https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/library/database-documentation/current/ver90/FIADB%20User%20Guide%20P2_9-0_final.pdf).
* __`plt_ECOPV`__ and __`ecopro`__: `plt_ECOPV` is a 471×2 data frame showing the ecoprovince of FIA plots. `ecopro` is a 5×2 data frame showing the mapping relationship between codes and names of ecoprovinces contained in these plots. These [ecoprovince codes and names](http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/48672) are adopted in FIA.
